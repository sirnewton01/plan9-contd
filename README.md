# Plan 9 - Continued

Plan 9 did much to bring the clunky and complex Unix environment into the modern era in the mid-1980’s. It proved in a variety of ways that you can actually get more with less with equal measure simplicity with consistency. One example among many was the adoption of the file system as the common method of communicated between processes, the operating system kernel and even the across the local network. The network effects of this metaphor helped to redefine the Plan 9 system as more than just a regular computer operating system into an operating system for an entire network of systems.

Since the 1980’s a number of factors have changed or evolved since the original inception of Plan 9. In some cases the new developments are just extensions of the ones that drove the development of Plan 9. Computers are increasingly networked together to provide services.
