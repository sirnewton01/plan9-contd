# Plan 9 - Continued

Plan 9 did much to bring the clunky and complex Unix environment into the modern era in the mid-1980’s. It proved in a variety of ways that you can actually get more with less with equal measure simplicity with consistency. One example among many was the adoption of the file system as the common method of communicated between processes, the operating system kernel and even the across the local network. The network effects of this metaphor helped to redefine the Plan 9 system as more than just a regular computer operating system into an operating system for an entire network of systems.

Since the 1980’s a number of factors have changed or evolved since the original inception of Plan 9. In some cases the new developments are just extensions of the ones that drove the development of Plan 9. Computers are increasingly networked together to provide common services as a single logical entity. However, in certain circumstances accesses to those systems is not always reliable or stable, such as over a mobile connection or even when moving between wifi hotspots with your laptop. Meanwhile, the computing power and storage of these mobile endpoints has continued its steady expansion over the years.

All of these changes have occurred on top of an ancient software base (ie. Unix/Linux/BSD and Microsoft Windows). Those bases were so lacking and unappealing that large software stacks erupted in order to drive the current cloud revolution and build magnificent user interfaces. Instead of simple, small and consistent the picture looks much the opposite.

If the current computing landscape was built on outdated base imagine what could be accomplished by applying Plan 9 as and its core principles. Further adaptations and modernization may still be required, but certainly far less than the effort spent and continues to be spent on the legacy systems.

## Filesystems over unreliable connections

## Networks within your machine

## Webs of text

## REST over simple file-systems

## Authentication

## TBD

The current state of this trend has led us to cloud computing. Instead of several servers on a locanetwork there are hundreds or thousands of individual servers in vast data centers around the world appearing as a single web site to end users. The internals of these systems are often composed of legacy Unix-based systems, such as Linux. The technology stacks that extend from the OS tend to re-invent rather than re-use and complement facilities provided by the OS. Each layer requires its own extensive learning and expertise.
